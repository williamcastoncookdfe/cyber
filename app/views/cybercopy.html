  <li>change the default administrator password, or disable remote access on each firewall</li>
  <li>protect access to the firewall’s administrative interface with multi-factor authentication (MFA), or a small specified IP-allow list combined with a managed password, or prevent access from the internet</li>
  <li>block inbound unauthenticated connections by default</li>
  <li>approve and document the reasons for allowed inbound traffic firewall rules</li>
  <li>review allowed inbound firewall rules often, change the rule when access is no longer needed</li>

<p>Security systems are sometimes disabled to make very marginal improvements to user experience. This is an unjustifiable risk calculation in most circumstances.</p>
<p>Attackers scan for and exploit devices where the security features are not enabled. Using the security features that devices already have is the most basic form of cyber security.</p>
<p>Attackers who gain physical access to a network device can exploit a system much more easily, so this should be prevented.</p>

<p>To meet this standard you must:</p>
<ul>
  <li>keep a register, list or network diagram with all the devices in your network or network segment, if the network is larger than one institution</li>
  <li>make a choice about which features to use on your network if network devices have conflicting security features</li>
  <li>remove or disable unused user accounts, including guest and unused administrator accounts</li>
  <li>change default passwords</li>
  <li>remove or disable all unnecessary software according to your organisational need</li>
  <li>disable any auto-run features that allow file execution without user authorisation</li>
  <li>set up filtering and monitoring services to work with the network’s security features enabled</li>
  <li>require user authentication to access organisational services or data, for instance, only allow viewing of public-facing data</li>
  <li>immediately change passwords which have been compromised or suspected of compromise</li>
  <li>protect against a brute-force attack on all passwords by allowing no more than 10 guesses in 5 minutes, or locking devices after no more than 10 unsuccessful attempts</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use a password or PIN of at least 6 characters to physically access switches, BIOS settings on end-user devices and similar. The password or PIN must only be used to access this device.</p>
<p>For all other devices, you must enforce password strength at the system level. If you use a deny list for automatic blocking of common passwords, use a password with at least 8 characters. Or, use a password with at least 12 characters or a biometric test.</p>
<p>Password manager software is recommended.</p>

<p>Successful cyber attacks target user accounts with the widest access and highest privileges on a network.</p>

<p>If you prevent and limit the compromise of these accounts you prevent and limit successful cyber attacks.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-meet-the-standard-2">How to meet the standard</h3>
<p>School governors should approve the responsible administrator when your school headteacher or staff member controls access to other accounts.</p>
<p>Otherwise, ask your IT service provider or network manager to set up accounts to meet the technical requirements.</p>
<p>There must be a user account creation, approval and removal process. You should make this part of school joining and leaving protocols.</p>
<p>Your IT service provider may be a staff technician or an external service provider.</p>
<p>Remember that this standard may change over time with changing cyber threats.</p>
<h3 id="technical-requirements-to-meet-the-standard-2">Technical requirements to meet the standard</h3>
<p>You must control user accounts and access privileges. Including accounts used by third parties, for example, support services or device management.</p>
<p>Only authorised people can have an account which allows them to access, alter, disclose or delete the held personal data. The data protection officer or the data controller must identify and authorise these tasks.</p>
<p>Users should have a separate account for routine business, including internet</p>
<p>access, if their main account:</p>
<ul>
  <li>is an administrative account</li>
  <li>enables the execution of software that makes significant system or</li>

<ul>
  <li>can make changes to the operating system</li>
  <li>can create new accounts</li>
  <li>can change the privileges of existing accounts</li>
</ul>
<p>Users must be authenticated before they access devices or services with unique credentials. This can include using passwords.</p>
<p>You must enforce password strength at the system level. If you use a deny list for automatic blocking of common passwords, use a password with at least 8 characters. Or, use a password with at least 12 characters or a biometric test.</p>
<p>The National Cyber Security Centre provides guidance on <a rel="external" href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/passwords">password administration for system owners</a>.</p>
<p>You must immediately change any password that has been compromised or suspected of compromise.</p>
<p>You must remove unused accounts. This may include the accounts of users who have left their employment, or accounts that have not been used for a prolonged period of time. This is particularly important for accounts with administrator privileges. You should review this termly.</p>
<p>Unused role privileges must be removed or disabled.</p>
<p>No user’s account should have more access to devices than required to carry out their role.</p>
<p>Use different accounts with specific rights for different purposes. Do not use the same account for different purposes. For example, one account should not be able to access both financial and teaching data.</p>
<p>For younger children or users with special educational needs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>consider using authentication methods other than passwords</li>
  <li>consider using a separate account accessed by the teacher rather than the student</li>
  <li>segment the network so such accounts cannot reach sensitive data</li>
</ul>
<p>You should not use Global Administrator accounts for routine business.</p>
<p>You should only use accounts requiring administrator privileges to complete the tasks that need it.</p>
<p>You should use service accounts for running system services and not user accounts.</p>
<p>As an alternative, IT service providers and administrators can enable just-in-time access, which gives time-limited user privileges to individual accounts as required.

<p>Multi-Factor Authentication reduces the possibility of an attacker compromising an account. This is especially important if an account has access to sensitive or personal data.</p>
<p>Multi-factor authentication only allows access to a service when you present 2 or more different forms of authentication. This can be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>something a user knows (such as a password)</li>
  <li>something a user has (like a specific device)</li>
  <li>something the user is (like a biometric device, or in a specific location)</li>
</ul>
<p>In this context, sensitive data is all data:</p>
<ul>
  <li>that if lost or compromised, would have a serious impact on the establishment, staff or students</li>
  <li>not considered personal data</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-to-meet-the-standard-3">How to meet the standard</h3>
<p>Ask your IT service provider to set up your devices with the multi-factor authentication methods which meet the technical requirements.</p>
<p>You should provide training to users unfamiliar with multi-factor authentication.</p>

<p>Where practical, you must enable multi-factor authentication. This should always include cloud services for non-teaching staff.</p>
<p>You only need to ask users for a second authentication factor when accessing sensitive data. For example, when moving from lesson plans to MIS.</p>
<p>Any multi-factor authentication is better than none.</p>
<p>Multi-factor authentication should include at least two of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>passwords constructed in the formats described earlier in standard 3</li>
  <li>a managed device, that may belong to the organisation</li>
  <li>an application on a trusted device</li>

<p>So that appropriate risk assessment and mitigation can take place, your IT service provider should tell leadership and governors at the school or college when devices or software:</p>
<ul>
  <li>have become unsupported</li>
  <li>are about to become unsupported</li>
  <li>alter the network</li>
</ul>
<p>Your IT service provider may be a staff technician or an external service provider.</p>
<p>Remember that this standard may change over time with changing cyber threats.</p>

<h3 id="technical-requirements-to-meet-the-standard-6">Technical requirements to meet the standard</h3>
<p>All software must be currently licensed and supported. You should remove unsupported software. If this is not possible then you must only use the software on parts of the network which prevent all traffic to and from the internet.</p>
<p>Unsupported devices must only access segmented areas of the network which do not grant access to sensitive data.</p>
<p>You must keep anti-malware software and associated files and databases up to date.</p>
<p>You must enable automatic updates.</p>
<p>If forced, you must complete manual updates to hardware or software, including configuration changes, within 14 days of release where the vulnerability is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>described as high risk or worse</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>has a Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSSv3) score of 7 or above</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>When notified by the Department for Education (DfE), patches should be applied within 3 days of notification. This will only be done in instances of dangerous zero-day attacks where institutions are at immediate risk and there is a suitable patch available.</p>

<p>A backup is an additional copy of data, held in a different location, in case the original data is lost or damaged.</p>
<p>Backups of important data are crucial for quick recovery in the event of disaster. The safest way to achieve this is to have a pattern of backing up on a rolling schedule. You should keep these backups off the network when not in use and check them regularly.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-meet-the-standard-7">How to meet the standard</h3>
<p>Ask your IT service provider to install and configure your devices to meet the standards described in the technical requirements. If your IT service provider is an external contractor, the scope of this should be included in your service agreement.</p>
<p>Be prepared to ask your service provider to explain what they are doing to help you achieve this standard. Including where the backups are located,  how often they are done, how often they are checked and how long a restoration will take.</p>
<p>The National Cyber Security Centre has published detailed guidance on:</p>

<p>You should have at least 3 backup copies of important data, on at least 2 separate devices. At least 1 of these copies must be offsite.</p>
<p>You should schedule backups  regularly and as needed by the institution. How often you need to create backups depends on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>how often the data changes</li>
  <li>how difficult the information would be to replace if the backups failed</li>
</ul>
<p>At least 1 of the backups must be offline at all times. An offline backup is sometimes known as a cold backup.</p>
<p>If the offline backup is in the cloud, access must be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>by a secure account identity</li>
  <li>from a device which cannot access the backup when the backup is not in use</li>
</ul>
<p>The number of devices with these access permissions must be kept to an absolute minimum.</p>
<p>A secure account identity is defined as a specified account secured with a username and password.</p>
<p>A device which cannot access the backup is defined as a device that has no valid credentials.</p>
<p>Where the cloud services allow it, set up the controls to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>only allow authorised devices to create new or appended backups</li>
  <li>deny connection requests when backup is not in use</li>
</ul>
<p>Regularly check that the backups work.</p>
